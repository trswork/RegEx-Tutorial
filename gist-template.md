## Regex Components

### Anchors
Anchors match a position within a string, not a character.

### Quantifiers
Quantifiers are used to indicate that the preceding token must be matched a certain number of times.

### OR Operator
OR Operator can use the | operator (logical OR) to match characters or expression of either the left or right of the | operator.

### Character Classes
Character classes are used to match a character from a specific set. You can define your own sets or there are a number of predefined characters classes.

### Flags
Flags can change how the expression is interpreted. They also follow the closing forward slash of the expression.

### Grouping and Capturing
Groupings allow you to combine a sequence of tokens to operate on them together. 

Capturing groups are a way to treat multiple characters as a single unit. To create this place the characters to be grouped inside a set of parentheses.  

### Bracket Expressions
A bracket expression is either a matching list expression or a non-matching list expression. Consists of one or more expressions(ordinary characters, collating elements, equivalence classes, or character classes).

### Greedy and Lazy Match
Greedy Match means the regex engine matches as many characters as possible.

Lazy Match means the regex engine matches the shortest possible string. 

### Boundaries
Boundaries refer to a position between \w and \W, or at the beginning or end of a string if it begins or ends with a word character.

### Back-references
Back-References refer to a regular expression identifies a previously matched group and looks for exactly the same text again.

### Look-ahead and Look-behind
The lookahead asserts that what immediately follows the current position is one or more word characters, and captures these characters to Group 1. 

Lookbehind has the same effect, but works backwards. It tells the regex engine to temporarily step backwards in the string, to check if the text inside the lookbehind can be matched there.
